# SOLID

Solid is actually an acronym and that represents five different design principles:

- Single Responsibility Principle

`There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.`

- Open Closed Principle

`Software entities (classes, modules, methods etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.`

- Liskov Substitution Principle

`We should be to substitute base class objects with child class objects & this should not alter behavior/characteristic for program.`

- Interface Segregation Principle

`Client should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.`

- Dependency Inversion Principle

`A- High level modules should not depend upon low level modules. Both should depend upon Abstractions.`

`B- Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon Abstractions.`

# Design Patterns
